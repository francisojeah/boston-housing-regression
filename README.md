# Regression Analysis with Boston Housing Dataset

This project involves building a regression model to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) using the Boston Housing Dataset. The analysis tests key assumptions for regression models and interprets the results to understand the impact of socio-economic factors on housing prices.

## Objectives

- Build a regression model to predict housing prices.
- Test assumptions: linearity, exogeneity, multicollinearity, homoscedasticity.
- Interpret the regression analysis results.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-Learn

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/francisojeah/boston-housing-regression.git
   ```
2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**:
   Navigate to the project folder and open `Boston_Housing_Regression.ipynb` with Jupyter Notebook.

## Project Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and clean the dataset.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualize relationships and detect patterns.
3. **Model Building**: Construct a regression model.
4. **Assumption Testing**: Validate model assumptions.
5. **Interpretation**: Analyze coefficients and predict housing prices.

## Results

The analysis reveals significant relationships between housing prices and socio-economic factors such as crime rate, the number of rooms, and accessibility to highways.
